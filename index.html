         <h1>Their Lives depend on your donation</h1>
         <p>Over 72% of Sylhet district is under water with over 6 million people have been affected by severe flooding
            in Bangladesh. In Sylhet overflowing rivers have flooded almost every area in the seven upazilas.

            According to the Sylhet Water Development Board (WDB), river water has never risen so much since 2008. This
            is the biggest flood in the last 3 decades and WDB officials fear the flood situation could worsen further
            if the rains continue upstream.</p>

         <h1>They need us to survive</h1>
         <p>People of Sylhet have gone under water in third within a month. The worst flood in 122 years has killed at
            least 25 people, stranded over 4 millions of people, kept out of power, shut down the airport and entire
            city. The government has deployed army to speed up flood rescue and relief efforts. "After waiting whole day
            on the roof of our home, a neighbour rescued us with a makeshift boat. Asma Akter, another woman rescued
            from the rising waters, said her family had not been able to eat for two days. "The water rose so quickly we
            couldn't bring any of our things," she said. "And how can you cook anything when everything is underwater?"
            Please help and stand by them immediately</p>
